Description: Computation of standardized interquartile range (IQR), Huber-type skipped mean (Hampel (1985), <doi:10.2307/1268758>), robust coefficient of variation (CV) (Arachchige et al. (2019), <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1907.01110>), robust signal to noise ratio (SNR), z-score, standardized mean difference (SMD), as well as functions that support graphical visualization such as boxplots based on quartiles (not hinges), negative logarithms and generalized logarithms for 'ggplot2' (Wickham (2016), ISBN:978-3-319-24277-4).
