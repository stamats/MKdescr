abstract = {The ability to identify active compounds (“hits”) from large chemical libraries accurately and rapidly has been the ultimate goal in developing high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. The ability to identify hits from a particular HTS assay depends largely on the suitability or quality of the assay used in the screening. The criteria or parameters for evaluating the “suitability” of an HTS assay for hit identification are not well defined and hence it still remains difficult to compare the quality of assays directly. In this report, a screening window coefficient, called “Z- factor,” is defined. This coefficient is reflective of both the assay signal dynamic range and the data variation associated with the signal measurements, and therefore is suitable for assay quality assessment. The Z-factor is a dimensionless, simple statistical characteristic for each HTS assay. The Z-factor provides a useful tool for comparison and evaluation of the quality of assays, and can be utilized in assay optimization and validation.}

  Abstract                 = {{In this article the simplest situation, namely estimation of a location
 parameter in the potential presence of outliers, is treated by means of
 a Monte Carlo study. This study yields Monte Carlo variances of the ''arithmetic
 mean'' after rejection of outliers according to several classical and recent
 formal rules. \par The results are also compared with those for other robust
 estimators of location parameters. It turns out that a simple summary and
 theoretical explanation of the Monte Carlo results is provided by the breakdown
 points of the combined rejection-estimation procedures. As a by-product,
 the concept of breakdown point also leads to a better understanding of
 the so-called ''masking effect'' and can in fact replace the latter concept.
 \par Formulas for the breakdown points are given for the six types of rejection
 rules used. Some general aspects and properties of all methods for the
 rejection of outliers and their relation to other robust methods are also
 discussed.}},

    abstract = { The coefficient of variation (CV) is commonly used to measure relative dispersion. However, since it is based on the sample mean and standard deviation, outliers can adversely affect it. Additionally, for skewed distributions the mean and standard deviation may be difficult to interpret and, consequently, that may also be the case for the 
CV. Here we investigate the extent to which quantile-based measures of relative dispersion can provide appropriate summary information as an alternative to the CV. In particular, we investigate two measures, the first being the interquartile range (in lieu of the standard deviation), divided by the median (in lieu of the mean), and the second being the median absolute deviation, divided by the median, as robust estimators of relative dispersion. In addition to comparing the influence functions of the competing estimators and their asymptotic biases and variances, we compare interval estimators using simulation studies to assess coverage. }
