  Abstract                 = {{In this article the simplest situation, namely estimation of a location
 parameter in the potential presence of outliers, is treated by means of
 a Monte Carlo study. This study yields Monte Carlo variances of the ''arithmetic
 mean'' after rejection of outliers according to several classical and recent
 formal rules. \par The results are also compared with those for other robust
 estimators of location parameters. It turns out that a simple summary and
 theoretical explanation of the Monte Carlo results is provided by the breakdown
 points of the combined rejection-estimation procedures. As a by-product,
 the concept of breakdown point also leads to a better understanding of
 the so-called ''masking effect'' and can in fact replace the latter concept.
 \par Formulas for the breakdown points are given for the six types of rejection
 rules used. Some general aspects and properties of all methods for the
 rejection of outliers and their relation to other robust methods are also
 discussed.}},
